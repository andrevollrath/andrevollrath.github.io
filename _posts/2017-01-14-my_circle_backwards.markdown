My road to software development has been long and winding. I've always been curious about computers ever since the first one appeared in our living room. 

My first attempt at coding was in high school and I remember the wonders of Visual Basic. It seemed so exciting but at the time I was frustrated with what I could accomplish with it. Sure I could program an interface that could add two numbers but I didn't see where that would take me or how I could accomplish something bigger.

I didn't really get very far with Visual Basic but when I entered college in 2003, I juggled the idea of getting a degree in copmputer science. The first couple courses were very Java oriented and once again, I failed to see the practicality. Back then the coding landscape seemed like a different beast. The idea of being able to create a startup with a handful of people and creat something amazing seemed unlikely. I ended up completing a BCOM and have been in accounting for the last eight years.

There has always been something missing with accounting. By chance, I started dabling with some code last year and then began to entertain the idea of a bootcamp. However, I had recently started a company and the timing was off. Fast forward 8 months and due to limited traction, I began to consider alternate pursuits. When I stumbled across community bootcamp it was a no brainer. Now that I've become immersed in Learn.co I can't stop.
